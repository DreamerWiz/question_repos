## Introduction

In this task, we will enhance a smart contract named `MyERC1155`, which allows users to mint new ERC1155 tokens by paying a certain fee. The new feature we will add is a refund policy: users can refund their minted tokens within a certain period (7 days in this case) and get their minting fee back. The contract will burn the refunded tokens.

## Objective

Complete the `mintItem` and `refundItem` functions in the `MyERC1155` smart contract, enabling it to mint new ERC1155 tokens, refund tokens within the refund period, and handle the refund of excess payment.

Write a Hardhat test script that tests the following scenarios:
- A user mints a new token with the exact minting fee, which should succeed.
- A user mints a new token with more than the required minting fee, which should succeed, and the excess funds should be refunded.
- A user refunds a token within the refund period, which should succeed, and the minting fee should be refunded.
- A user tries to refund a token after the refund period, which should fail.

## Hint

- Use the `_mint` function to mint new ERC1155 tokens.
- Use the `_burn` function to burn refunded tokens.
- Use the `msg.sender.transfer` function to refund the minting fee.
- Use the `block.timestamp` to get the current timestamp and calculate the refund period.

## Side Knowledge

- ERC1155 is a standard in Ethereum for creating multi-token contracts, i.e., contracts that can handle multiple tokens at once. It combines the capabilities of ERC20 (fungible tokens) and ERC721 (non-fungible tokens).
- In Solidity, you can use `msg.value` to get the amount of ETH paid to a function. You can also use `msg.sender.transfer` to send ETH to the address of `msg.sender`.
- The `block.timestamp` is a global variable in Solidity that gives the current timestamp as seconds since the Unix epoch. Be aware that miners have some influence over the value of `block.timestamp`, so it should not be used for critical components of your contract where accuracy of within a few seconds is important.
- The `revert` function in Solidity can be used to abort a function execution and revert all changes to the state. It can also provide an error message that can help with debugging.
